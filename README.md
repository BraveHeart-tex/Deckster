# **Deckster: Agile Scrum Poker Estimation Made Simple**

**Deckster** is a real-time, modern, web-based tool designed to facilitate agile sprint planning through collaborative Scrum Poker estimation. Built with remote teams in mind, it streamlines story point estimation, fosters engagement, and promotes accurate planning in a fun and effective way.

## ‚ùì Why Deckster?

Deckster was born out of a real-world need.
At work, our team relied on a popular Scrum Poker tool‚Äîbut key features like custom decks, advanced collaboration options, and integrations were locked behind a paywall.
Rather than continue with a restricted tool, I decided to build a free and open alternative that gives full control to teams‚Äîno feature gating, no subscriptions.

It was also the perfect opportunity to experiment with Convex, a cutting-edge backend platform that promises reactive, serverless data without the traditional boilerplate. Deckster became both a solution to a pain point and a playground for exploring powerful new tooling.
